Real space simulations of twisted bilayer graphene.

> **Warning**
> This does not relate to my research and I haven't worked on TBG in a long time. There is a significant lack of reproducibility in the TBG numerics space. Treat everything related to this repo (and TBG numerics more broadly) with caution.
